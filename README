geany is a nice lightweight ide but lacked syntax highlighting and auto-complete for javascript, let alone V8 or node.js.

Putting that right just meant building 2 files (on the Downloads page):

filetypes.javascript to go in ~/.config/geany/filedefs for highlighting

Javascript.js.tags to go in ~/.config/geany/tags for auto-complete


You can also set 
  node %f 
as the compile command to run the script you are currently editing.
