geany is a nice lightweight ide but lacked syntax highlighting and auto-complete for javascript, let alone V8 or node.js.

Putting that right just meant building 2 files (on the Downloads page):

filetypes.javascript to go in ~/.config/geany/filedefs for highlighting

Javascript.js.tags to go in ~/.config/geany/tags for auto-complete


You can also set 
  node %f 
as the compile command in geany 0.18 to run the script you are currently editing.

Alternatively, in geany 0.19 you can set a couple of build commands for js source files:
  node %f
press F8 to run 
and (if you have installed node-inspector)
  node ~/node/node-inspector/bin/inspector.js --start=%f
press F9 to start debugging.
